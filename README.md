# Summary: 

The current dataset selected for analysis didn’t have any written reviews from Amazon Vine members. At this point, I am unable to look for a possible bias toward favorable vine member reviews. Before reaching any conclusions, we should look into the reason why this product, gift card, doesn’t have any written reviews.
